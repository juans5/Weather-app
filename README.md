This is my first app created with Html, Css and JavaScript 
it's a project so simple with the more basics skills for a web developer
it's a Weather app, you put a country or city like Germany and it give you the temperature in degree Celsius with others characteristics like wind speed and humidity percentage.

but, it is not really mine, this project is created by @GreatStack and relesead in his youtube channel with so many others tutorials creating apps.
